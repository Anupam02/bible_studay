When we get saved, God puts new heart and new Nature, but mind is still same.
dont let your mind overpower your heart.

Be in Christ , God gives us enablement to do things that we can't do before.

Be Thankful -> reflect Christian Life
Constant Mind Renewal
God is doing it ( initiates ) - I have to respond
, when I respond , its qualitatively New.

Seeking the things which are above.
or Seeking the things which is below.

Ability to forbear one another
Ability to forgive one another

Not only to save us, but also to mature us.
